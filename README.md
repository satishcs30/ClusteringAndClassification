# Clustering And Classification
Unsupervised learning | Factors that influence health outcomes in a county

On https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ , the University of Wisconsinâ€™s Population Health 
Institute has published rankings of all 3142 counties in the US by their health outcomes and 
behaviors. In this project, clustering and classification techniques are applied to the data from 
2021 to determine if there are interesting groupings of counties with similar health outcomes 
and behaviors, and develop a predictive model to see which factors influence health outcomes. 
Individuals and governments can use such a model to improve public health outcomes.
